						<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As a part of the younger generation who cares about the natural environment around us, we are aware that Indonesia is a country full of natural resources. These natural resources should be utilized as best as possible. Natural resources in Indonesia are divided into many crops and plants, so we decided to use coconut as the main natural resource for our biotechnology products. The benefits of coconut are numerous, but coconut itself is mostly used to create coconut oil. With that being said, a lot of coconut water ends up being wasted.
						<br>	
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Based on the data we obtained, to obtain 1 liter of coconut oil, 13 coconuts are needed. Hearing this, we felt that it would be a shame if the coconut water was thrown away. In the end, it would lead us to waste food. Quoting from the Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Sampah Nasional (SIPSN), cases of food waste that have occurred in Indonesia have reached 46.35 tons and are ranked second in the country with the most food waste in the world in 2022. 
						<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We felt concerned and wanted to overcome this problem. Because of that, we chose to produce coconut water as a drink topping, called nata de coco. When people eat coconuts, they tend to only eat the coconut meat. The coconut water is then thrown away and turned into food waste. We decided to fix this issue by using the excess coconut water to make nata de coco. 
						<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then, the nata de coco will be sold through our lemon squash, and no food gets wasted in the end. The excess coconut water will be used to make nata de coco. However, before it finally becomes nata de coco, the coconut water needs to be fermented with several other ingredients to become dense and textured nata de coco. The materials needed include; coconut water, nata de coco starter, urea, granulated sugar, and vinegar. Meanwhile, the tools we need include; a basin, pan, spoon, measuring cup, whisk, food scale, and newspaper. These items are needed for the nata de coco to form. After all the ingredients have been mixed The water resulting from all the ingredients that have been mixed and stirred thoroughly must be fermented for approximately 7 days.
						<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The whole process was really fun to go through, however, we faced some difficulties during the process. The nata de coco wasnâ€™t formed very well during the first and the second try. Thankfully, the third time was the charm, and we finally succeeded in making the nata de coco. The nata de coco that we ferment will eventually be used as a drink topping for our signature drink called "Lemon Squash". The lemon squash is prepared with a refreshing touch of ice, soda, lemon syrup, lemon juice, nata de coco, and basil seeds. The taste of nata de coco included in the lemon squash gives a refreshing and exciting sensation when you drink it. 
						<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Based on our experience and that of consumers, the lemon squash we produce is proven to be very refreshing in the midst of the hot weather currently hitting Indonesia. It even revives the enthusiasm of students, teachers, and all buyers!
