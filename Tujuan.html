				<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
					<p>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As a part of the younger generation who cares about the natural environment around us, we are aware that Indonesia is a country full of natural resources. These natural resources should be utilized as best as possible. Natural resources in Indonesia are divided into many crops and plants, so we decided to use coconut as the main natural resource for our biotechnology products. The benefits of coconut are numerous, but coconut oil itself is mostly used to create coconut oil. With that being said, a lot of coconut water ends up being wasted. Based on the data we obtained, to obtain 1 liter of coconut oil, 13 coconuts are needed. Hearing this, of course we felt that it would be a shame if the coconut water was thrown away, and over time becomes a habit to waste food. Quoting from the Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Sampah Nasional (SIPSN), cases of food waste that have occurred in Indonesia have reached 46.35 tons and are ranked second in the country with the most food waste in the world in 2022. 					
					<br><br>		
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We felt concerned and really wanted to overcome this problem. Because of that, we chose to produce coconut water as a drink topping, called nata de coco. When people eat coconuts, they tend to only eat the coconut meat. The coconut water is then thrown away and turned into food waste. We decided to fix this issue by using the excess coconut water to make nata de coco. The nata de coco is then sold through our lemon squash, and no food gets wasted in the end. The excess coconut water was used to make nata de coco. However, before it finally becomes nata de coco, of course the coconut water needs to be fermented with several other ingredients to become dense and textured nata de coco. The materials needed include; coconut water, nata de coco starter, urea, granulated sugar and vinegar. Meanwhile, the tools we need include; basin, pan, spoon, measuring cup, whisk, food scale, and newspaper. These items are needed in order for the nata de coco to form. The water resulting from all the ingredients that have been mixed and stirred thoroughly must be fermented for approximately 7 days.
					<br><br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The process was really fun to go through, however, it was very tough. We even failed two times where the nata de coco wasnâ€™t formed. Thankfully, the third time was the charm, and we finally succeeded in making the nata de coco. The nata de coco that we ferment will eventually be used as a drink topping for our signature drink called "Lemon Squash". The lemon squash is prepared with a refreshing touch of ice, soda, lemon syrup, lemon juice, nata de coco and basil seeds. The taste of nata de coco included in the lemon squash gives a refreshing and exciting sensation when you drink it. Based on our experience and that of consumers, the lemon squash we produce is proven to be very refreshing in the midst of the hot weather currently hitting Indonesia. It even revives the enthusiasm of students, teachers and all buyers!
